# thisbotdoesnotexist

## Description

thisbotdoesnotexist is a unique project that combines advanced image generation, procedural attribute creation, and AI-powered chat capabilities to create and interact with unique, non-existent individuals, and each new session creates a completely different character to interact with. It mimics the concept of the 'thispersondoesnotexist.com' website but with a more immersive and comprehensive twist.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PeW9WDgzZ4) of the project working.

## Features

1. **Image Generation**: thisbotdoesnotexist generates realistic images of non-existent people. 

2. **Procedural Attribute Generation**: Beyond just images, the system also creates a complete persona for each generated individual, including their characteristics, biography, likes, dislikes, and more.

3. **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: All details are then passed to a state-of-the-art language learning model, like GPT-4, which uses these details to simulate conversation with the generated individual.

4. **Text-to-Speech System**: Each generated persona comes with a unique voice, created through our advanced text-to-speech system, allowing users to hear responses from the persona, enhancing the level of interaction and realism.
